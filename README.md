# The Drawing Thing

This repository contains the soruce code of the research product named *The Drawing Thing* as part of research activities investigating wearable Internet of Things and the Self within the [Open Design of trusted Things - OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org.) project.

The content of this repository can also be found online under: https://github.com/opendott-wats/D2.3-Documentation-of-Prototype

# Repository Contents

The repository contains code and documentation of for an iOS application which allows to draw on the screen with virtual "ink" that is generated by the step count recorded by the phone itself.
The code was iteratively modified and adapted as part of a series of unstrcutured interviews/conversations with a participant during a study. The data from these conversations contains transcripts and drawings made by the participant with their data.

The choice of iOS as a platform was part accidental due to fact it being a stack pf hardware ready at hand; and part because of the comparably high privacy precautions put up by the operating system and respectively the HealthKit API. Furthermore is presented a well working distribution system for updates in a remote setting in which during the Covid-19 pandemic an in-person meeting with the participant was not possible.


## Documentation of Protoypes

### step 1

ideating and sketching with step data as a follow-up activity to the haptic memories concept

### step 2

create an experience prototype which can support haptics using a smartphone 

### making hardware (feasible)

Try to create a step counter using available open technology and other electronic modules.

- Show data captures
- Picture of the compact boards

conclusions

### step 3

Time line of co-design process during study.
